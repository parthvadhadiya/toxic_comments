Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

Just be it is a contraversy page doesn't allow you state lies or add OR, you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that.  Even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources.  Just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesn't mean anyone in mainstream has.  Can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth?  Then insert it.

       "160  \"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

He's one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian.  Regarding his study, it hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the results have appeared in many reliable sources.  In effect, it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter.  Literally tens of thousands of Wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists, which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter.   \n",

The UN defines Vietnam to be part of Southeast Asia. And far as I know Vietnam is part of ASEAN, and used to be part of French Indochina with Laos and all those shit countries Anyway your culture has always been more influenced by SEA than Han Chinese (as in proper Yangtze Han Chinese, not the fringe indigenous tribes in Guangzhou/Guangxi). \\n\\nJust admit that you vietnamese are all a bunch of wannabe crap people. ALL the east asian people I've spoken to thinks of Vietnam as a very integral part of SEA, and we all think you're backward, dirty and speak in a horrible swearing language. Doesn't matter what crap you spout on Wikipedia, won't change the way people in the real world think.   \n",

But what is this?! has the community not gotten smaller? was it not caused by the automobile? have I not sourced the statement as asked? is it not a fact? is it not information? does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? if so it should be noted that I simply re-added the information after it was removed. was not the removal frivilous and unwarranted? what is the problem? why insist on the absence of this statement? it is unjustifiable. it is negligible. I am re adding the information as it is: A)factual, B) sourced, and C) informative. I assume that since there is no reason to remove it again (or in the first place) that you and all other Wiki Nazis will relax. If you are concerned with useless edits please see the edit fom the 26th. I know it was carried out by the great infallable Mindmatrix but imho that was the first useless change. \"   \n",

WTF?  \\n\\nWould data from the whole of California count for you?  The private and public Waldorf schools in California have 'Personal Belief Exemption' rates of 12% to 88% of their kindergarten classes.  Regardless of what the official position is - and I assert here, but would not do so in the article, that the 'official' position was a lie in order for Waldorf education to not appear like a complete cult - Waldorf students are grossly under vaccinated.  That fact should be in the article.   \n",

I'll take a deep breath and have a go at an intro tomorrow. I identified the source of the phrase London over the border, and showed that the boundary is contested in the footnote. I've clarified the diaspora section, and will justify the statements by reference to the Victoria History articles on West Ham and East Ham. Hopefully, I'll struggle to a justification without substantially changing the outcome of the previous discussions. Then move onto to standardising the references, probably section by section.   \n",

But nevertheless important because I merely underlienes the mythomania propagated by both sides. My only interest here is historical reality. Dab, why don't you actually analyze the situation rather than offerring your usual smart-alec remarks. Lontech's arguements have been shot to pieces summarily, and everytime this happens, he engages in tangential and irrational behaviour. Commonsense will tell you there was no long-lasting state or kingdom in Dardania before Roman times. We can;t just allow the intro paragraph to read like some KLA recruiting web-site   \n",

There is no policy that says homosexual scouts cannot be members.  To state otherwise is a lie and OR.  Just be it is a contraversy page doesn't allow you state lies or add OR, you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that.  Even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources.  Just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesn't mean anyone in mainstream has.  Can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth?  Then insert it.  Unless you have it or an actual policy from BSA that says you can't be an openly homosexual youth member then what is being added is OR.   \n",

If even highlighting and selecting the shape in Inkscape makes it unusable, then I shouldn't even be messing with Inkscape at all.   \n",

      "58        My Band Page's deletion. You thought I was gone. \\n\\nDeleting the comment I posted on your 'talk page' does not delete my feelings for your hasty decision to delete my page. You, sir, are still a cock-sucking douche fuck. Sit back for a second and think about what your life has become. ............ Done? That didn't take long did it? Nope. Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker. So, go eat some more food and drown your sorrows you premature ejaculating, bald headed fuck.\\n\\nYou should do something nice for yourself, maybe go grab a couple of Horny Goat Weeds from your local convenience store and jack off for a little longer than three minutes tonight.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nAn Asshole That's Better Than You In Every Way.\n",

Cunts like you who revert good edits because you're too stupid to understand how to write well , and then revert other edits just because you've decided to bear a playground grudge, are the problem.

But he is clearly listed as being \"\"second only to Batman\"\" and a \"\"master detective and martial artist\"\" and been trained in all the mentioned combat discplines. No need to mention in skills/abilities about the battles he's lost and won because thats not what an encylopia is supposed to do. \\n\\nAlso, what your problem is your going by low end showings and not HIGH end showings where he's proven more than a match for a meta like Slade and pinned Shiva down in one of his earliest appearences.\\n \"\n",

The kind that hides but not willing to play fair is intellectually true to his believes or ideas of fairness. \\n\\nIf you think I'm wrong then look at this thug's history and you will see I'm right.\\n\\nThe only way with Goethean is his way, or no way, he as no respect for those that think different and is a bigoted thug.\n",

The one homo that is responsible for vandalism on rep Wilson's page is a cock sucking, cross burning republican. It is so cute to see a severely retarded shut-in try out wikipedia and think that she can save it from the communists. Joe Wilson did something never before seen in a joint session of congress, he shit his pants, I mean he yelled at his superior in the military chain of command. You really have to be a low lying pussy to defend a white trash hick. There is a reason the democrats won the election for both congress and the white house, that is why fags like you are left in the dust grabbing on to hilarious conspiracies about the birth certificate and dipshit jesus's death panels. You lost for a reason, get over it loser! Just pretend Wilson will be ignored and that people haven't seen your bullshit excuse \"\"mother jones aint credible, boy howdy\"\" and \"\"please include a faggot conservative blog about jesus coming back to earth\"\" to defend that southern fried hick for yelling nonsense at a joint session where people dress up and are supposed to act like adults, not southerners. I saw you were banned from editing numerous times, especially about violet something or other, so congratulations! Take the dildos out of your ass and ears and wake up, you ass is done for! Lucky for you, the page is locked and truth remains there about all of his stupid actions, ha ha!\\n\\nGO FUCK YOURSELF YOU LITTLE PUSSY!!!\\n\\nP.S. jesus tapdancing motherfucking christ aint coming back, cause if he did you wouldn't be here\"\n",

Given the misuse of tools here and the itchy trigger finger as exemplified by the thread above, this \"\"admin\"\" needs to be examined by Arbcom. I'm not surprised to see a thread already open at ANI discussing it's recent behavioural trends. I won't be initiating anything but will most certainly be presenting evidence at the appropriate time. In the meantime someone needs to tell this \"\"admin\"\" to calm the fuck down and stop removing comments mad by editors on their own talk pages. That's a blockable offence, especially when they were told to never post here again. INVOLVED much?   \"\n",

I said fucking sorry for my little brother and you still had to fucking complain. My life is fucking shit. My mother is always yelling at me and my dad beats the shit out of me if I get fucking out of line. My brother's one outlet is wikipedia. He cried when he saw my father smacking me, and his tears clogged his mac book pro's keyboard. we had to go to fucking apple and get a new one, all out of my mom's pocket. then last night i wanted to take this hot pussy from connecticut out in my dad's new rolls-royce and he said fucking no. so you know what I fucking did? I fucking cut his pinky off and didnt snitch like a little bitch like you. I take lazy ass niggers like you and stomp you with my fat nazi heel. you should be FUCKING sorry you ever fucked with me or my dad (Steve Jobs). And if I find out your using Linux, I'll take pity on thee. Cause you're just too stupid to understand shit. i can see your fucking at some fucking computer and you think that you have some power on this fucking site. let me tell you something you little bitch. when i'm doing coke off strippers titties in da clubz, you can just edit some fucking wikipedia articles. i smoke a phat blunt every damn day, and you smoke your mom's fucking tea. So, in closing, as Shakespeare said in Sonnet ninety-four (I believe): \"\"things turn sourest by their deeds. Lillies that fester smell far worse than (fucking) weeds.\"\"\\nfuck you and heil hitler.\\n\\n-n. jobs\\n\\nps- if you ever fucking ban this ip again, there is going to be some serious shit thats gonna happen. i know a fucking guy.\"\n",

       "160    \"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

He's one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian.  Regarding his study, it hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the results have appeared in many reliable sources.  In effect, it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter.  Literally tens of thousands of Wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists, which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter.\n",

The UN defines Vietnam to be part of Southeast Asia. And far as I know Vietnam is part of ASEAN, and used to be part of French Indochina with Laos and all those shit countries Anyway your culture has always been more influenced by SEA than Han Chinese (as in proper Yangtze Han Chinese, not the fringe indigenous tribes in Guangzhou/Guangxi). \\n\\nJust admit that you vietnamese are all a bunch of wannabe crap people. ALL the east asian people I've spoken to thinks of Vietnam as a very integral part of SEA, and we all think you're backward, dirty and speak in a horrible swearing language. Doesn't matter what crap you spout on Wikipedia, won't change the way people in the real world think.\n",

But what is this?! has the community not gotten smaller? was it not caused by the automobile? have I not sourced the statement as asked? is it not a fact? is it not information? does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? if so it should be noted that I simply re-added the information after it was removed. was not the removal frivilous and unwarranted? what is the problem? why insist on the absence of this statement? it is unjustifiable. it is negligible. I am re adding the information as it is: A)factual, B) sourced, and C) informative. I assume that since there is no reason to remove it again (or in the first place) that you and all other Wiki Nazis will relax. If you are concerned with useless edits please see the edit fom the 26th. I know it was carried out by the great infallable Mindmatrix but imho that was the first useless change. \"\n",

If even highlighting and selecting the shape in Inkscape makes it unusable, then I shouldn't even be messing with Inkscape at all.\n",

I think Davies is borderline notable, but the article is not.  I spent an hour googling Davies earlier today and found nothing except that he has translated a lot of stuff.  Well, I have done a lot of stuff in my life.  I'm even borderline notable in a small field, but nothing to warrant an article on me, especially one that precisley nothing links to like this one.  Frankly I hope the author just makes it notable.  I'll respond to him with gentlemanly politesse, but I can;t help him any further.\n",
